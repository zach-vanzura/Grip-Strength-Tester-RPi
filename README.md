# Grip Strength Tester Using a Raspberry Pi  
### By Zach Vanzura and Charlie Nix
This project is a grip strength tester using a strain gauge and a Raspberry Pi. 
It uses an HX711 analogue to digital signal converter to convert the analogue strain gauge signal to digital which the pi can recognize. The end goal of the project is to have a strain gauge set up so that a user can squeeze to apply strain which will then be measured and displayed on a website. Ideally, we would like to had some entertainment functionality to the website as well. Such as a loading bar animation that fills up the harder it is squeezed or a display of the ranges of grip strength of animals and where the user falls into that category.
